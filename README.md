CountryPages is a webring and a character database, bringing back the spirit of Geocities Neighborhoods. 

It is an affiliate of [alephdfilms](https://alephdfilms.github.io/), so you should check that out, too.

## I came here to join the webring, not look at the code!
Cool. There's a link for that [right here](http://countrypages.duckdns.org/join.html).

## I submitted my site and it's not in yet!
Cool. I'll check if you properly submitted it or not.

## Is this website ever going to host websites?
Maybe. Wait, wait, _HELL NO_. You know how much electricity that'll use?!

Hell, Github Pages exists, and you can use it to host a personal website. [Just make a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and [follow this guide to learn how to get started](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

Or you can use [Neocities](https://www.neocities.org), that's way easier. :)

## Why does this site feel unfinished?
Everything is unfinished on Geocities, and this site (as of 06/04/23) is still under construction.
