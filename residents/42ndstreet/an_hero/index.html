Gee, it sure is boring around here...
<br>
My boy, this peace is what all true warriors strive for.
<br>
I just wonder what Ganon is up to...
<br>
Your Majesty, Ganon and his minions have seized the island of Koridai.
<br>
Hmm... How can we help?
<br>
It is written: "Only Link can defeat Ganon."
<br>
Great! I'll grab my stuff!
<br>
There is no time. Your sword is enough.
<br>
How about a kiss? For luck.
<br>
You've got to be kidding.
